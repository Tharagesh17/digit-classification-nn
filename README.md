# digit-classification-nn
Neural network for digit classification using NumPy and Pandas
Digit Classification Neural Network
A simple feedforward neural network built from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas for handwritten digit recognition (e.g., MNIST dataset).

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of neural networks without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or Keras. It includes data loading with Pandas, matrix operations with NumPy, forward/backward propagation, and basic training for classifying digits 0-9.

Features
From Scratch Implementation: Custom sigmoid activation, weight initialization, and gradient descent.

Dataset Handling: Loads and preprocesses CSV data (e.g., 'train.csv' with 784 pixel features).

Training and Prediction: Achieves reasonable accuracy on digit classification tasks.

Extensible: Easy to add layers, change activations, or implement mini-batches.

Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Install dependencies via pip:

text
pip install numpy pandas
Setup
Clone this repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-classification-nn.git
Navigate to the project directory:

text
cd digit-classification-nn
Ensure you have a dataset like 'train.csv' (e.g., from Kaggle's MNIST competition) in the root folder.

Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and test the model.

Example Code Snippet
python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
X = data.iloc[:, 1:].values / 255.0
y = data['label'].values

# ... (full code in neuralnetwork.ipynb)
To train:

Open neuralnetwork.ipynb in Jupyter and execute the cells.

Adjust hyperparameters like hidden_size, learning_rate, or epochs for better results.

To predict on a new image:

python
sample_image = X[0].reshape(1, -1)  # Example input
predicted_label = predict(sample_image)[0]
print(f"Predicted digit: {predicted_label}")
Project Structure
neuralnetwork.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook with the neural network code.

train.csv: Sample dataset (not included; download from sources like Kaggle).

README.md: This file.

Results
On the full MNIST training set, expect around 90% accuracy with default settings. Tune for higher performance!
